The engine use a custom assets type called Medieval Engine Data File (.dat)

It's a simple container type for all the assets used in the core of the game engine

On the mod-land its possible to use custom dat files by only requiring the
right library on the lua file.

With that said its obvious that we need at least one lua file on the right folder
(to be determined yet).

Example loading a custom assets file (custom.dat)

local DAT = require('DATFile') -- require the library
DAT.open('custom.dat') -- open the file

-- we could as verify if the file was open correctly with an if

require(DAT.get('lua_file_inside_the_dat_file.lua') -- this would execute the lua file



-- Its very important to say that there is no folders inside the assets files,
so all the file name must be unique.


The default asset file opened by the engine is named base.dat and must have:
- defaul.ttf - Default font file for the GUI and all the Text if some font fail to load
// TODO(Pedro): implement this, if font fail load the default font...
